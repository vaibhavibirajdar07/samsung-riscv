<summary><b>Task 1:</b>Task is to install all the essential tools required for this samsung-RISCV  Workshop such as Ubuntu on VMBox & refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler</summary><br>

### Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Oracle Virtual Machine Box

Firstly, I have downloaded the virtual box from the links provided to us and
loaded a linux version with image dock file sent  
![Ubuntu and VMBox Installation](https://github.com/vaibhavibirajdar07/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task%201/virtual_machine_installed.png)

### C Language based LAB
I have successfully run the virtual machine and compiled the tasks.

Initial task is:-

### write a program to compile the sum of first 5 natural numbers in c:

we have written the code sum of 1st 5 numbers in leafpad as shown below.


gcc sum_1ton.c

./a.out


this code will be run in terminal to get output as 15 for 1st 5 numbers as shown below :

### RISCV based LAB

1. Using the cat command, the entire C code will be displayed on the terminal.

2. A program is run to obtain risc-v version of the code previously written in c:

  	 
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c

3. As the whole version of above code looks lengthier we have used below code to make it shorter
	
 	
	riscv64 -unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
	
 
& we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :

4. Open the same terminal and run the given command:
 
 	
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c

5. As the whole version of above code looks lengthier as earlier we have used below code to make it shorter
	
 	
	riscv64 -unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
	
 
& we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :
